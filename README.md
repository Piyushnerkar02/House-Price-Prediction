# House-Price-Prediction

This project is a **machine learning web application** built using **Flask** that predicts house prices based on user input features such as the number of rooms, location, area, etc. It utilizes a trained regression model to make predictions and displays the results in a simple and interactive web interface.

## 🚀 Features

- Machine Learning model trained on housing data (e.g., from Kaggle or scikit-learn datasets)
- Web interface using Flask framework
- User input form for prediction
- Real-time prediction of house prices
- Clean and minimal design

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **scikit-learn** (for ML model)
- **Flask** (for backend server and routing)
- **HTML/CSS/Bootstrap** (for frontend UI)
